#Text Summarization

## Overview
Text Summarization is one of those applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is bound to have a huge impact on our lives. With growing digital media and ever-growing publishing – who has the time to go through entire articles/documents/books to decide whether they are useful or not? Thankfully – this technology is already here.  

My goal In the two projects is to scrape and summarize the article from the Arabic website And English website so the first project for [the Okaz newspaper website](https://github.com/Sara04ia/Text_Summarization/blob/main/Okaz_Text_Summarizing.ipynb) is to summarize an Arabic article. It is an article about a girl who talks about International Father’s Day, its goal, and the purpose of commemorating and remembering it.

the second project is about [the Washington Post](https://github.com/Sara04ia/Text_Summarization/blob/main/The_washington_post.ipynb) it summarizes an English article and it's about The Pentagon’s massive new telescope is designed to track space junk and watch out for killer asteroids

### This project has two main tasks :
1. scraping Okaz news websites to get the articles by using: `urllib.request`, `BeautifulSoup`
2. summarizing the articles  by using the libraries : `nltk`, `heapq`and `collections`
