# Text_Summarization
Text Summarization is one of those applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is bound to have a huge impact on our lives. With growing digital media and ever-growing publishing – who has the time to go through entire articles/documents/books to decide whether they are useful or not? Thankfully – this technology is already here.  My goal In this project is to summarize the article on the Okaz newspaper website. It is an article about a girl who talks about International Father’s Day, its goal, and the purpose of commemorating and remembering it.
